        <h3 style="text-align: center;">Reflection on industry data</h3>
          <h4>Christopher</h4>
            <p style="text-align: center;">Christopher identified software engineer as his ideal job. In the Burning Glass Institute (2018c) data provided, this job title ranked 12th with 539 job postings. Although no mention of skills specific to the use of Azure or web framework, data was shown that ranked hypertext preprocessor/PHP skills at number 12 in the most demanded skills from employers (Burning Glass Institute, 2018a). Generally, IT experience ranked 73rd in the most demanded skills and leadership ranked 12th (Burning Glass Institute, 2018b).  </p>
            <p style="text-align: center;">After analyzing the data provided, Christopher is still interested in a career as a software engineer but also now has an equal interest in a career as a front end developer. This is because the skill ranking of javascript ranked higher and from further research on Seek (nd) found there are 3835 job advertisements posted as of the access date. This indicated to Christopher that the industry has a high need for the skills required for the position of front-end developer. </p>
          <h4>Benjamin</h4>
            <p style="text-align: center;">Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nunc sollicitudin commodo mauris, vel lacinia ligula blandit quis. Morbi a gravida nunc. Vivamus ullamcorper ante urna, ac porta quam pulvinar nec. Suspendisse in porttitor nunc, at vulputate magna. Nullam ornare massa mi, venenatis semper tortor ultricies a. Pellentesque at tellus id nulla pulvinar convallis. Donec eleifend est sed dolor dictum porta. Pellentesque vitae finibus velit, non suscipit lorem. Praesent pharetra massa ac nulla aliquet placerat. Vestibulum eleifend vestibulum magna vel bibendum. Quisque ac accumsan mi, quis mollis dui. Interdum et malesuada fames ac ante ipsum primis in faucibus. In sodales mauris.</p>
          <h4>Andy</h4>
            <p style="text-align: center;">Andy identified Data Warehouse Manager as his ideal job. Within the Burning Glass data, this job title does not appear, however ‘Data Warehouse Developer’ does. This job is not highly ranked at #192, however could be an entry level into a data warehouse environment.  </p>
            <p style="text-align: center;">Andy’s in-demand skills do not have Azure specifically referenced however skills such as ASP (30) is framework to work with Azure. Linux is listed as 10th in demand skill. The top IT skills which are not in the require skill set are SQL 1st, Javascript 2nd and Java 4th. Writing, communication and problem-solving skills are not specifically referenced in Andy’s required skill sets for this role, however would be highly advantageous.  </p>
            <p style="text-align: center;">Review of the Burning Glass data made Andy realise this is not a highly sought-after role. This doesn’t change the appeal of the ideal job however it does focus hisattention on other career opportunities through IT management. </p>
          <h4>Jennifer</h4>
            <p style="text-align: center;">Jennifer identified a Software Developer role for her ideal job.  Jennifer’s review of industry data provided her with an understanding that this is not the role for her as she has recently determined that she does not enjoy programming. Of the top IT Job titles reported within the Burning Glass dataset (Burning Glass Institute, 2018b), Software Developers ranked 19th out of the 200 roles assessed.  C# was the highest ranked skill required for the Software Developer role, ranking 6th out of the 200 skills assessed.  Git ranked 11th and Microsoft Visual Studio skills ranked 43rd.

          <h4>Jineshkumar</h4>
            <p style="text-align: center;">Jinesh identified Web Developer as his ideal job. In burning glass data, it does not rank however Web Analyst does rank at #144. This could be a way into Web Developer Job.</p>

          <h4>Shalimay</h4>
            <p style="text-align: center;">Shalimay identified her ideal job to be a Game Developer. This specific title does not appear in the ranked system of the Burning glass data however ‘Developer’ does appear at number 23 on the ranked list of job demand titles. Many skills involved with game development such as programming in C languages and using git can be translated easily into these in-demand jobs such as JAVA, a C language, ranks highly in demand for JAVA developer, Solutions Architect and Java Developer. All appearing in the top 10 of the top titles. </p>
            <p style="text-align: center;">Of the ranks in the Top IT Skills data, Microsoft C# ranks at #7, Git ranks at #12, and Visual Basic at #44.  Having assessed the data, Shalimay’s opinions have not changed as the goals for Game Developer as an occupation as this drive was more interest and hobby-driven rather than job stability in the industry of IT. It’s just happenstance that the cross-over skills are in high demand. </p>
