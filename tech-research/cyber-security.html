    <h2>What is cybersecurity?</h2>
  </div>
</div>
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-12" style="background-color: grey;">
    <p>Cyber security is the practice of defending computers, servers, mobile devices, electronic systems, networks, and data from malicious attacks. It's also known as information technology security or electronic information security. The term applies in a variety of contexts, from business to mobile computing, and can be divided into a few common categories. Two Categories that are part of cybersecurity are listed below.</p>
    <h3>Network Security</h3>
    <p><em>Network Security</em> Is the practice of security of a computer network from intruders, whether targeted attackers or opportunistic malware. Network security consists of the policies and practices adopted to prevent and monitor unauthorized access, misuse, modification, or denial of a computer network and network-accessible resources. Network security involves the authorization of access to data in a network, which is controlled by the network administrator.</p>
    <h3>Application Security</h3>
    <p><em>Application Security</em> Is focuses on keeping software and devices free of threats. A compromised application could provide access to the data its designed to protect. Successful security begins in the design stage, well before a program or device is deployed. This includes the work administrators and application security engineers do to better understand why applications expose vulnerabilities to exploitations in security and how to make them safer in the future.</p>

    <h2>How cybersecurity has evolved.</h2>
  </div>
</div>
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-12" style="background-color: grey;">
    <p>Cybersecurity has evolved repeatedly in the past decade according to the founder of CYBERSAFE. It was not a big part of the IT infrastructure till the hackers got smarter over the years and it got easy to get personal and business information. Cyber terrorism is known to widespread fear in computer more like malware. That can be used to get important information without business knowing. It can also damage the computers to make money or even have a political motivation behind it. &#128110;</p>
    <p>One of the ways that cybersecurity has evolved is that before we could use any password for our Gmail, Facebook, twitter etc. But wouldn’t know if it was strong enough for anyone else to guess it, now the apps give some sort of error or message that tells us its either not long enough or it’s too easy to guess or it’s common. There are some apps that gives an option to turn on 2 step verification, which means even if someone guessed your password the system askes for a verification code which gets send to the user’s phone number or selected email address sometimes even an app that user selects to help with verifications. All these new systems show how cybersecurity has evolved in the past 5-10 years.</p>

    <h2>Impact of Cybersecurity and Job Opportunities</h2>
  </div>
</div>
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-12" style="background-color: grey;">
    <p>Potential impact of this development - With new systems and software developing to help securing business and personal computer files and information it has helped many people in daily computer tasks. From securing your account passwords to securing major file that are important to an organization, cyber security plays a big role in this era as there are many trojans and malware around. When talking about having such a security it also important to talk about someone who takes the responsibility of making sure this security works the way it’s designed for.  Since this development has been a such rise in the IT industry it has also created a new job know as Security Analysts, their job is to design, and implanting security measures while considering organizations requirements. They are also to properly configure and update security software’s and creating a plan of action in case a security breach happens.</p>
    <p>Security Analysts are not always behind a computer or updating software’s, there are less technical sides such as updating employees on security protocols, working to prevent type of attacked called “Social Engineering”- these attacks rely more on human error rather than technical errors. According to the Bureau of labor Statistics most security Analysts work in the computer industry, others are working in finance and insurance, company management or administrative and support services. With having flexibility of working from home or at the office, the analysts are also required to be on call at nights or weekends in case there are after office hours security breach.</p>
    <p>With the service of cyber security the most effected people are the business owners and the high-end officials. Business owners are affected in a good way because they can now stop worrying about data being easily hacked into. People owning big companies are in constant worries about their data security. With the help of these software’s at least they can cross that little bridge with ease. In 2020 research it shows that without the help of this software, adults over the age of 75 and younger adults who have little to no Cybercrime knowledge are target of Cybercrime.</p>
    <p>I work as Computer Tech and in my daily routine there are so many files and company details coming in that I don’t want anyone to just get into. So Cyber security software plays a big role there. As company has many clients’ personal information stored its very important for us to have the best and saftest Security for it. If there was no software available to help us secure the data, it will be very hard for the client to trust us with their information and potentially could be a very big loss for the company. Not with just company’s data but also with my social media information which is very important to me is safe because each social media has a form of security available. For example, every time the account is logged into new device it sends a text and email to my set email address to notify me that account was logged in a different location, and if it was not me then the hacker will require a code or some sort of Authorization to access the account.</p>
    <p>If we didn’t have such security for our social medias and emails, there is a high chance that there will be security breaches happening often then what we have now. With new statistics outlining that there are nearly 1600,000 Cyber security breaches happen in just an HOUR around the world. With taking that into account our social media gets targeted nearly 20-25 times every hour, if my account wasn’t secured then my information would be accessible easily.</p>
    <p>When it comes to the effect on my family, my parents are getting old and with that they care less and less about having secure password and social media accounts. Sometimes they forget the password they used or can’t remember the log in details. If the default security measures weren’t in place my parents wouldn’t be able to re-set the password or get access to the log in details. Re-setting the pass requires you to go through some verification steps to identify who is trying to access the account. Security like that helps older people resetting password easily and stop from any hacker getting into their accounts.</p>
