      <h2 style="color: white; text-align: center;">Team Summit's Skill Reflection</h2>
        <p style="color: white; font-size: 24px;">Team Summit used the Burning Glass data provided to assess the skills required of each ideal job. Together, Team Summit reflected on the skills they all identified in order to find commonly related skills required for their ideal jobs. After reflection, Team Summit found that the ideal jobs had a vast array of diverse skills and no one skill was common throughout the entire set of job titles. However, there were a few IT specific and general skills that were common throughout over half of the dream job titles.  </p>
        <p style="color: white; font-size: 24px;">C# and Azure related skills ranked as the highest common skills being mentioned in four out of the six job titles. Microsoft Visual Studio skills ranked as the second most common IT specific skill with three out of the six dream job titles mentioning the need for it in research done by Team Summit members. After reflection, Team Summit decided that these three skills were the most common IT specific skills within the set. </p>
        <p style="color: white; font-size: 24px;">Experience was also ranked as one of the highest occurring job skills required amongst the Team Summit ideal job skill set with four out of six of the job titles mentioning the requirement of experience in some sort of form at least once. Leadership qualities and skills were one of the next most commonly shared skills that employers requested on the job advertisements researched by Team Summit members. Three out of six job advertisements researched identified leadership as a skill required for the position. This is why Team Summit chose to include leadership as well as experience in their identified list of commonly shared skills required for their dream job. </p>
        <p style="color: white; font-size: 24px;">After reflecting on their ideal jobs and the skills required, Team Summit decided that C#, Azure, Microsoft Visual Studio, experience and leadership where commonly shared skills required for their ideal jobs and will investigate these skills further as the team project progresses. </p>
