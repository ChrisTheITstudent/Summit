    <h1>Myers-Briggs Test</h1>
    <p>My Myers-Briggs test result is PROTAGONIST.  Which means people who are born leaders and ten to be vocal about their values, including authenticity and altruism.  The result tests mean that I can help, lead and keep the team together. As protagonist I can help people keep motivated and do what’s right for them. When team is forming, I can be a great help when organizing team meetings, keeping notes and project together and lead the team in the Project.</p>
    <h2>Learning Test</h2>
    <p> I learn easily by DOING IT (kinesthetic Learning), its where I learn quickly and pick up new information by doing it hands on experience with. With this learning skill, I’m confident to do the task hand on and learn very quickly from it. As visual IS my secondary learning style I can pick up information quickly by looking at it, when a team creates a chart or diagram with each member’s task and to-do list, I can clearly acknowledge my task.</p>
    <h3>Big Five test</h3>
    <p> One of my big five tests results is that I'm very self-consciousness, means that we are sensitive about what others might think of us or just generally like to be well presentable in front of people, so they won’t think low of us.</p>
