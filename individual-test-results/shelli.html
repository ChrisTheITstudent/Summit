      <h2>How Do I Take This Into Account When Forming A Team</h2>
          <p>When forming a team, this personality would be more than willing and gladly work with a variety of people and personality types. They would thrive mostly with a team with a set leader, set tasks and expectations. This kind of personality although very versatile, some considerations should be made such as making sure the team they are inserted into doesn’t have too many strong personalities clashing with one another that may disrupt order and processes. Ideally the team should be filled with similar personality types as they just want to complete what needs to get done and help one another to reach the end goal.</p>
