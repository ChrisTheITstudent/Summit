      <h2>What do these results mean to me?</h2>
      <p>The general consensus of the two personality-based tests (16 personalities[1] and big 5[2]) was that my strengths lie in making sure that people’s needs come before my own, that I thrive on routine and structure and have a strong sense of duty to my obligations. This personality type needs structure and respects hierarchy and relies on clear tasks. I take on a lot of responsibilities and care deeply about my peers’ feelings. I enjoy being around people and need to work on a team as I get fulfilment in helping others and bringing people together.. Although my strengths lie in connecting to others, the other side of this is being too sensitive and I often worry and try very hard not to upset people. It makes me vulnerable to criticisms and will generally avoid conflicts and divert topics to do so. I can draw accuracies from my learning style test[3] as I do learn by seeing how a task is done, I picture ideas in my head before I implement them. My results state that I am attracted to colour and stories that are rich in imagery which I can attest to as I find the most enjoyment from games and entertainment that is visually appealing and rich in colour use and detailed design, I also love a great spoken story that I can play out the images in my mind. Although a lot of the values align with my behaviours and my beliefs, there are many that do not. I have taken the Myer-Briggs test multiple times with varying results which seem to be heavily influenced by whatever mood I’m in or varying stages of my life. Which is unsurprising as people grow and change over the years, their values shift due to life experiences. The same could be said for the big 5 personality test. The learning style test seems to be fairly accurate as I do find it a more effective way to learn when I see something being done. I seem to score fairly evenly in all areas however the majority falls into visual learning. Although some critiques I have is that the some of the questions may have varying answers for whatever mood you may be in. For instance, the question about what you do when you give directions where the choices are, describe landmarks, name streets or just get the person to follow you to the destination may not be a result of your capabilities to recall directions but may be a result of your consideration of the other person’s capabilities. There’s a lot of assumptions in there that aren’t really specified. You may even identify with multiple answers but the test only allows the choice of 1. So although the results may give you a fair idea of your learning style, maybe you learn effectively equally in multiple styles.</p>

      <h2>How Do I Think These Results Affect Me In A Team</h2>
          <p>These results suggest that my behaviour in a team would be to do what’s best and strive for a win-win situation where possible. I’d strongly push for structure and routine for tasks and a rule-set and use my personality to bring a team together without being too overbearing. Thus hopefully creating an environment where people are comfortable with speaking to one another and know what needs to be done and when. My team would come first and I would be the first to lend a hand where possible as I feel a strong sense of duty to my peers and completing tasks. Because I enjoy working in a team, I find it motivating to collaborate with others which would keep the project on track and keep discussion active thus hopefully keeping the team motivated.</p>
      <h2>How Do I Take This Into Account When Forming A Team</h2>
          <p>When forming a team, this personality would be more than willing and gladly work with a variety of people and personality types. They would thrive mostly with a team with a set leader, set tasks and expectations. This kind of personality although very versatile, some considerations should be made such as making sure the team they are inserted into doesn’t have too many strong personalities clashing with one another that may disrupt order and processes. Ideally the team should be filled with similar personality types as they just want to complete what needs to get done and help one another to reach the end goal.</p>
