          <h3 style="text-decoration-line:underline">Christopher</h3>
            <p>Christopher lives and was born in Brisbane, Queensland. He’s a 37-year-old father of two boys. Currently he has two lizards, one snake and two guinea pigs. His favourite thing to do to relax is to take a nice walk along the waterfront or watch the sunrise or sunset. Anything to do with water is really calming for Christopher but he also enjoys staying at home and playing video games or watching shows/movies. </p>
            <p>Christopher began a career in the early childhood education industry at a young age and during his fifteen years in the industry he gained a Certificate III and Diploma in Early Childhood Education as well as part of a Bachelor degree in the field.

            <h4>IT Interest</h4>
              <p>The interest started from games. I like games and I wanted to know how they worked and how they were made so maybe one day I could make my own. And whilst learning programming I had a realisation this is the future. That if I don’t learn something that so heavily influences the world around us, I would get left behind. I must adapt to the world around me and future-proof myself. So it’s lucky in a way it’s genuinely something I enjoy and am interested in. I like efficiency, if there’s an easier way to do things, I want to know or be able to figure it out. I also like to design things and IT covers all aspects of these interests as IT is everything from making things work to creating the user experience.</p>
            <h4>IT Experience</h4>
              <p>Although limited, my experience in IT mainly stems from game development. I’ve had a lot of involvement in the process of developing games like creating the UI, creating stories, programming , developing the user experience, learning how to use different software such as Github, Blender, Visual Studio, Unity, sourcetree, Photoshop, and Audacity. I’ve done game testing, I’ve recorded and presented data in spreadsheets that explains whether a game is balanced or not and I have very briefly touched on artificial intelligence and augmented reality.</p>

              <p>Shalimay is half Filipino and half Australian. Although she grew up in Australia, Shalimay still embraces the Filipino culture and celebrates their events and traditions. Shalimay graduated high school in 2014 and decided to work in dental assisting where she obtained certification and worked for four years. Although a really interesting and rewarding field to be in, Shalimay’s interest in games began to grow into something more of what she wanted to start a career in. Shalimay studied a Diploma of Game Development which gave her a fundamental understanding of programming which has then led her to study a bachelor of IT at RMIT university. In her spare time, Shalimay likes to either sew, play games with her friends, go for hikes, watch game playthroughs or learn something new. She also has three guinea pigs and a cat which keep her very busy.</p>

          <h3 style="text-decoration-line:underline">Benjamin</h3>
              <p>Ben was born and raised in country Victoria. In his younger years, his parents worked on sheep farms. Around age 9-14 Andy’s father managed pig farms. As a result, Ben was home schooled from grade 5 until re-entering school halfway through year 10. Ben did not complete year 10 and moved straight into work as a retail assistant where he completed ten years in various roles.</p>
              <p>A hobby of Ben’s to this day which began at an early age is gym, health and fitness. This led to my next detour in Ben’s life. Ben completed Certificates 3 and 4 in Personal Training and became a CrossFit powerlifting coach/Personal Trainer. This led to him working for a CrossFit gym which he eventually managed for a further three years. However, that business was sold so he decided to change direction in life again and head back into retail whilst beginning the journey to get into university. This journey began by completing approximately two years of steps which began with him swapping and changing degrees. However, Ben has finally started a degree he is ready to sink his teeth into at RMIT (Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology). A fun fact about Ben is that he likes to mountain bike - specifically downhill mountain biking. Ben has also been sky diving and likes to think he’s a bit of a thrill-seeker.</p>
              <p>Ben’s interest in IT did not begin until later in life due to not having a PC (personal computer) until around the age of 12. His interest was first peaked around the age of 18 when his best mate decided to undertake an IT degree. Up to that point he had never considered university or further study to be a possibility. However, it was still approximately another decade before he would decide to make the jump into further study. By this time his best mate had begun what is now a successful career with the Department of Defence as a Network Engineer. Along the way he developed an excellent group of friends with a passionate interest in IT. Furthermore, if that was not already enough to push him in the direction of IT, Ben's current girlfriend and soon-to-be wife (fingers crossed) also has a passion for game development and has recently completed a Diploma in game development. She is now also embarking on a journey to complete a degree in IT. With all this passion and interest in IT all around him, it was only a matter of time before Ben's interest was a sparked to the point where he would enrol in this current degree with RMIT.</p>
              <p>Ben’s experience in IT is limited although he enjoys playing games and talking to his mates about it. Although Ben's tech skills are limited, he does however possess many crossover skills from multiple team leadership roles in his earlier careers. For example, he has a strong skill set in conflict resolution, team motivation, and overall time management of large group-oriented tasks. This experience is due to the multiple management roles he has held over the years.</p>

          <h3 style="text-decoration-line:underline">Jineshkumar</h3>
          <p>Jinesh was Born in India but has been living in Australia since he was ten. Mainly he uses his native language which is Gujarati at home but since he has been here since the age of ten, feels like English is his first language. Jinesh currently works as a Computer Technician (Hardware) in Port Melbourne. A fun fact about Jinesh is that he learnt French when he was in High School and won second prize in a French Speaking competition.</p>
          <p>Jinesh’s interest in IT started when he first got a laptop for school. Jinesh always wondered how these machines worked and how all the different components came together. When it comes to repairing laptops, Jinesh broke the charging port in his own laptop. When he saw how the technician was fixing /repairing the motherboard, he was excited to get his hands onto fixing laptops. After Jinesh completed Year 11, he built his own PC and has wanted to work with computers since then.</p>
          <p>Jinesh chose to come to RMIT as before he started working full time as a Computer Technician, he studied at RMIT on campus towards a Certificate IV in IT. From studying Introduction to IT, Jinesh wishes to learn the basics of HTML and to learn how to get a website up and running. As he wants to be a Web Developer, this is the perfect place to get new information and study how websites are made.</p>

          <h3 style="text-decoration-line:underline">Andy</h3>
          <p>Andy is a new parent, in his mid-thirties and located in the south-east suburbs of Melbourne. He was born in Australia and speaks English. Andy loves PC gaming when he has time and also a good tv show. Andy’s previous education includes the VCE (Victorian Certificate of Education) and a range of Risk and Security courses arising from his work in the security industry.</p>
          <p>Andy’s interest in IT started at a young age when he was first exposed to Windows 3.1. He started taking computers apart, breaking them, fixing them and the rest grew from there. Andy works full time in an IT role as a product manager for security technology, which is a dynamic role including CCTV (closed-circuit television), access control, and enhancing security operations and systems in the shopping centre industry.</p>
          <p>Although Andy’s daily role is primarily concerned with information technology and systems, his skills and experience were developed on the job and from the personal interests outlined above. Through the Bachelor of Information Technology with RMIT through Open Universities Australia, Andy hopes to broaden his understanding of various IT systems and build a foundation for industry wide recognition.</p>
