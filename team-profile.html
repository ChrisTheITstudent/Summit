  </div>
</div>
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-12" style="background: grey;">
    <hr class="black-seperator">
    <p>Shalimay is half Filipino and half Australian. Although she grew up in Australia, Shalimay still embraces the Filipino culture and celebrates their events and traditions. Shalimay graduated high school in 2014 and decided to work in dental assisting where she obtained certification and worked for four years. Although a really interesting and rewarding field to be in, Shalimay’s interest in games began to grow into something more of what she wanted to start a career in. Shalimay studied a Diploma of Game Development which gave her a fundamental understanding of programming which has then led her to study a bachelor of IT at RMIT university. In her spare time, Shalimay likes to either sew, play games with her friends, go for hikes, watch game playthroughs or learn something new. She also has three guinea pigs and a cat which keep her very busy.</p>
    <p>Shalimay’s IT interest started from games. Shalimay wanted to know how they worked and how they were made so maybe one day she could make my own. Whilst learning programming she had a realisation that this is the future. That if she doesn't learn something that so heavily influences the world around us, she would get left behind. Shalimay feels she must adapt to the world around her and future-proof herself. So, it’s lucky in a way it’s genuinely something she enjoys and is interested in. Shalimay likes efficiency. If there’s an easier way to do things, she wants to know or be able to figure it out. She also likes to design things and IT covers all aspects of these interests as IT includes everything from making things work to creating the user experience.</p>
    <p>Although limited, Shalimay’s experience in IT mainly stems from game development. Shalimay has had a lot of involvement in the process of developing games like creating the UI (User Interface), creating stories, programming, developing the user experience, learning how to use different software such as GitHub, Blender, Visual Studio, Unity, SourceTree, Photoshop, and Audacity. Shalimay has done some game testing; she has recorded and presented data in spreadsheets that explains whether a game is balanced or not and she has very briefly touched on artificial intelligence and augmented reality.</p>

    <hr class="black-seperator">
    <p>Jinesh was Born in India but has been living in Australia since he was ten. Mainly he uses his native language which is Gujarati at home but since he has been here since the age of ten, feels like English is his first language. Jinesh currently works as a Computer Technician (Hardware) in Port Melbourne. A fun fact about Jinesh is that he learnt French when he was in High School and won second prize in a French Speaking competition.</p>
    <p>Jinesh’s interest in IT started when he first got a laptop for school. Jinesh always wondered how these machines worked and how all the different components came together. When it comes to repairing laptops, Jinesh broke the charging port in his own laptop. When he saw how the technician was fixing /repairing the motherboard, he was excited to get his hands onto fixing laptops. After Jinesh completed Year 11, he built his own PC and has wanted to work with computers since then.</p>
    <p>Jinesh chose to come to RMIT as before he started working full time as a Computer Technician, he studied at RMIT on campus towards a Certificate IV in IT. From studying Introduction to IT, Jinesh wishes to learn the basics of HTML and to learn how to get a website up and running. As he wants to be a Web Developer, this is the perfect place to get new information and study how websites are made.</p>

    <h4 style="font-size: 36px;">Benjamin</h4>
  </div>
</div>
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-12" style="background: grey;">
    <hr class="black-seperator">
    <p>Ben was born and raised in country Victoria. In his younger years, his parents worked on sheep farms. Around age 9-14 Andy’s father managed pig farms. As a result, Ben was home schooled from grade 5 until re-entering school halfway through year 10. Ben did not complete year 10 and moved straight into work as a retail assistant where he completed ten years in various roles.</p>
    <p>A hobby of Ben’s to this day which began at an early age is gym, health and fitness. This led to the next detour in Ben’s life. Ben completed Certificates 3 and 4 in Personal Training and became a CrossFit powerlifting coach/Personal Trainer. This led to him working for a CrossFit gym which he eventually managed for a further three years. However, that business was sold so he decided to change direction in life again and head back into retail whilst beginning the journey to get into university. This journey began by completing approximately two years of steps which began with him swapping and changing degrees. However, Ben has finally started a degree he is ready to sink his teeth into at RMIT (Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology). A fun fact about Ben is that he likes to mountain bike - specifically downhill mountain biking. Ben has also been sky diving and likes to think he’s a bit of a thrill-seeker.</p>
    <p>Ben’s interest in IT did not begin until later in life due to not having a PC (personal computer) until around the age of 12. His interest was first peaked around the age of 18 when his best mate decided to undertake an IT degree. Up to that point he had never considered university or further study to be a possibility. However, it was still approximately another decade before he would decide to make the jump into further study. By this time his best mate had begun what is now a successful career with the Department of Defence as a Network Engineer. Along the way he developed an excellent group of friends with a passionate interest in IT. Furthermore, if that was not already enough to push him in the direction of IT, Ben's current girlfriend and soon-to-be wife (fingers crossed) also has a passion for game development and has recently completed a Diploma in game development. She is now also embarking on a journey to complete a degree in IT. With all this passion and interest in IT all around him, it was only a matter of time before Ben's interest was a sparked to the point where he would enrol in this current degree with RMIT.</p>
    <p>Ben’s experience in IT is limited although he enjoys playing games and talking to his mates about it. Although Ben's tech skills are limited, he does however possess many crossover skills from multiple team leadership roles in his earlier careers. For example, he has a strong skill set in conflict resolution, team motivation, and overall time management of large group-oriented tasks. This experience is due to the multiple management roles he has held over the years.</p>

    <hr class="black-seperator">
    <p>Christopher lives and was born in Brisbane, Queensland. He’s a 37-year-old father of two boys. Currently he has two lizards, one snake and two guinea pigs. His favourite thing to do to relax is to take a nice walk along the waterfront or watch the sunrise or sunset. Anything to do with water is really calming for Christopher but he also enjoys staying at home and playing video games or watching shows/movies. </p>
    <p>Christopher began a career in the early childhood education industry at a young age and during his fifteen years in the industry he gained a Certificate III and Diploma in Early Childhood Education as well as part of a Bachelor degree in the field. After this, he studied Business Administration and developed a small ecommerce business. During this time Christopher learnt different aspects of IT including social media, SEO (Search Engine Optimisation) and very basic web design.</p>
    <p>His next step in life was becoming a content creator. Using the skills he already developed along with learning graphic design and video/media creation skills, he built a creator brand using the platforms YouTube, Twitch and TikTok which later also included twitter. It was during this time that Christopher developed an interest in JavaScript and coding as well as networking through using gaming as a base for content. Christopher wants to extend his knowledge both about the IT industry as well as the technical skills involved. Currently he’s employed as a Quality Assurance Officer with a large cold storage company and uses a variety of IT systems within his role. </p>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-12" style="background-color: rgb(12,60,96); color: white;">
    <p>Team Summit is made up of a diverse range of personality types. Each team member chose to provide a Myers-Briggs personality assessment, with a variety of other tests conducted for the other two required.</p>
    <p>The Myers-Briggs assessment (16 Personalities 2011-2022) showed a variety of results, with a few commonalities. The team comprises two Defenders, two Protagonists, one Consul and one Debater. This provides Team Summit with a balance of one Analyst, two Protagonist, and two Sentinel personality types. The Explorer and Analyst personality types are not represented within the team. Based on the Myers-Briggs explanations, Team Summit could be seen to lack imagination and flexibility/spontaneity. However, given the structured requirements of the assignment Team Summit is fortunate to possess traits including dedication, inspiration, curiosity, and caring natures.</p>
    <p>Four team members conducted a Big Five Personality Test. The results range between complete extroversion to introversion. The Learning Style Test (RMIT 2022) shows that most team members require a hands-on or tactile approach to learning. One team member provided a Favourite Types of Work Test, indicating a preference for investigative work and another provided a True Colours Test, indicating similar results to the Myers-Briggs assessment. Team Summit is fortunate to have access to the diversity of personality represented. This provides us with a range of perspectives that will allow for more effective decision making. However, the team will need to remain aware of the different learning and communication styles present within the team to ensure each member is adequately included and represented.</p>
