            <h4>IT Interest</h4>
              <p>The interest started from games. I like games and I wanted to know how they worked and how they were made so maybe one day I could make my own. And whilst learning programming I had a realisation this is the future. That if I don’t learn something that so heavily influences the world around us, I would get left behind. I must adapt to the world around me and future-proof myself. So it’s lucky in a way it’s genuinely something I enjoy and am interested in. I like efficiency, if there’s an easier way to do things, I want to know or be able to figure it out. I also like to design things and IT covers all aspects of these interests as IT is everything from making things work to creating the user experience.</p>
            <h4>IT Experience</h4>
              <p>Although limited, my experience in IT mainly stems from game development. I’ve had a lot of involvement in the process of developing games like creating the UI, creating stories, programming , developing the user experience, learning how to use different software such as Github, Blender, Visual Studio, Unity, sourcetree, Photoshop, and Audacity. I’ve done game testing, I’ve recorded and presented data in spreadsheets that explains whether a game is balanced or not and I have very briefly touched on artificial intelligence and augmented reality.</p>

          <h3 style="text-decoration-line:underline">Benjamin</h3>
            <h4>Background/hobbies</h4>
              <p>Hi my name is Benjamin duke I was born and raised in country Victoria, in my younger years my parents worked on sheep Farms, and around age 9-14 my dad got various jobs managing pig farms. Furthermore, this led to me being home Schooled from grade 5 till re-entering school halfway through year 10 this led to me not completing year 10 and moving straight into work as a retail assistant where I completed 10 years in various roles.</p>
              <p>A hobby I have to this day which began at an early age was gym and health and fitness this led to my next detour in life, I got my cert 3 and 4 in personal training and became a CrossFit powerlifting coach/pt, this led me working for a CrossFit gym which I eventually manage for a further 3 years.</p>
              <p>However, that business ended up being sold so I decided to change the direction in life again and head back into retail and begin the journey of getting into university. This journey began by completing approximately 2 years of steps which then began with me swapping and changing degrees over the next few years.</p>
              <p>However, I have finally landed a degree I am ready to sink my teeth into here at RMIT (Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology).</p>
              <p> A fun fact about me is I also like to mountain bike and to be more specific downhill mountain biking. I have also been sky diving and I like to think I'm a bit of a thrill-seeker.</p>
            <h4>Interest in IT</h4>
              <p>My interest in it did not begin until later in life due to not having my first pc till around the age of 12, my interest was first peaked around the age of 18 when my soon-to-be best mate decided to undertake an IT degree with CQU university up that point I had never considered university or further study to be a possibility.</p>
              <p>However, it was still approximately another decade before I would decide to make the jump into further study and by this time my best mate had begun what is now a successful career with the department of defence as a network engineer along the way he developed an excellent group of friends with a passionate interest in IT which along the way have also become my friends.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, if that was not already enough to push in the direction of It my current girlfriend and soon-to-be wife's finger crossed, also has a passion for game development and has recently completed a diploma in game development and is now embarking on a journey to complete a degree in It. With all this passion and interest in IT all around me, it was only a matter of time before my interest was a sparked to the point where I would enrol in this current degree with RMIT.</p>
            <h4>IT experience</h4>
              <p>The experience I currently have in IT is limited unless playing games and talking to my mates about it and doing uni assignments counts. Although my tech skills are limited, I do however possess many crossover skills from multiple team leadership roles in my other careers, for example, I have a strong skill set in conflict resolution team motivation, and overall time management of large group-oriented tasks this experience is due to the multiple management roles I have held over the years.</p>

          <h3 style="text-decoration-line:underline">Jineshkumar</h3>
          <p>Jinesh was Born in India but been living in Australia since I was 10. Mainly we use my native language which is Gujarati at home but since I have been here since I was 10, feels like English is my first language. I currently work as Computer Technician (Hardware), in port Melbourne. Fun Fact about me is that I learnt French when I was in High School and got 2nd Prize in a French Speaking Comp.</p>
          <p>My interest in IT started when I first got my laptop for school, I always wondered how these Machine Worked and how all different components came together to make a single computer work. When it comes to Repairing Laptops, I broke the Charging port in my laptop and when I saw how the Technician was fixing /repairing the Motherboard got me excited about getting my hands fixing laptops. After I passed year 11, I built my own PC and wanted always work with Computers since then.</p>
          <p>I chose to come to RMIT because before I started working full time as Computer Technician, I was studying at RMIT (on campus), learning CERT IV in IT. As RMIT stands for Royal Melbourne Institution of Technology, I realized this could be the University where I start my IT Studies.</p>
          <p>From studying Introduction to IT, I wish to learn the basic HTML, and learn how to get a website up and running. As I want to be a Web Developer this is the perfect place to get new information and study how website is made.</p>

          <h3 style="text-decoration-line:underline">Andy</h3>
          <p>Hi there! I'm Andy. I am a new parent, in my mid-thirties located in the south-east suburbs of Melbourne. I was born in Australia and speak English. Love PC gaming when I have time and also a good tv show. My previous education includes VCE and a range of Risk and Security courses arising from my work in the security industry.</p>
          <p>My interest in IT started at a young age when first exposed to Windows 3.1. I started taking computers apart, breaking them, fixing them and the rest grew from there. I work full time in an IT role as a product manager for security technology, which is a dynamic role including CCTV, access control, and enhancing security operations and systems, in the shopping centre industry.</p>
          <p>Although my daily role is primarily concerned with information technology and systems, my skills and experience were developed on the job and from the personal interests outlined above. Through the Bachelor of Information Technology with RMIT through Open Universities Australia I hope to broaden my understanding of various IT systems and build a foundation for industry wide recognition.</p>
